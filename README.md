## 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence Course Overview**

### 🎯 **Purpose of the Course**

This course was designed to introduce students to the core principles and foundational methodologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Its primary goal was to help students build a strong conceptual understanding of how AI systems are designed, how they function, and how they can be applied to solve both theoretical and real-world problems. Emphasis was placed on key AI concepts, diverse search strategies, and intelligent decision-making in dynamic scenarios such as strategy games.

### 📚 **Key Learnings and Skills Acquired**

Over six months, I gained both theoretical foundations and practical experience in these core areas:

#### 🔍 **Uninformed Search Techniques**

* 🔄 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
* 🔽 **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
* 🕳️ **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**
* 🔁 **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
* 🔃 **Bidirectional Search**

#### 💡 **Informed Search & Heuristics**

* 🎯 Heuristic-Based Search Strategies
* ⭐ **Best-First Search**
* 🗺️ **A\*** (**A-Star**) Algorithm
* 🔗 **AO\*** Algorithm
* 🧗 **Hill Climbing**
* 🌐 **Beam Search**

#### 🎮 **Game AI & Decision-Making**

* ♟️ **Minimax Algorithm**
* ✂️ **Alpha-Beta Pruning**

These concepts were strengthened through practical projects where I developed AI agents for classic strategy games:

* ♟️ **Chess**
* ❌⭕ **Tic-Tac-Toe**
* 🟡🔴 **Connect Four**

These implementations provided hands-on experience in simulating intelligent behavior and optimal decision-making in turn-based games.
